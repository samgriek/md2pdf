Generic single-database configuration.

## Alembic migrations
> By default the api will apply any outstanding migrations when it is started. After updating the `app.database.models`, run `docker-compose up`, then run the below command to generate the migration (note that you must review that it was created correctly)
```bash
docker exec -it contenz-io-api-1 alembic revision --autogenerate -m "migration message"
```

### Test your migration locally
> build
```bash
docker build -t <image_name>:latest .
```
> run
```bash
docker-compose up
```
